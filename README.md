# BNPParibas
This is a simple Java application developed as a developer test demo for BNP Paribas.
This can be improved in many aspects, but to keep it simple they are not included. Some of the simple extensions could be...
- logging using a framework such as slf4j-log4j
- test coverage reports can be generated using jacoco
- project info report
- documentation
